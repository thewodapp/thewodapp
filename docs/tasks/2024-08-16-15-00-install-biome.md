# Task: Install and configure BiomeJS

## Commit 1: feat: add biomejs dependency [docs/tasks/2024-08-16-15-00-install-biome.md]

**Description:**
Install `@biomejs/biome` as a development dependency using pnpm. An exact version will be pinned to ensure consistency across all development environments.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    - **Command:** `pnpm list @biomejs/biome`
    - **Expected Outcome:** The command should show that `@biomejs/biome` is installed under `devDependencies`.
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `pnpm exec biome --version`
    - **Expected Log:** The command should output the installed version of Biome, confirming the package is executable.
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** N/A

## Commit 2: chore: remove eslint and prettier [docs/tasks/2024-08-16-15-00-install-biome.md]

**Description:**
To prevent tool conflicts and streamline the development process, ESLint, Prettier, and all related configuration packages (e.g., `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-react`) will be uninstalled. The `eslint.config.mjs` file will also be deleted.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    - **Command:** `grep -E "eslint|prettier" package.json || true`
    - **Expected Outcome:** The command should produce no output, confirming that no ESLint or Prettier dependencies remain in `package.json`.
    - **Command:** `test ! -f eslint.config.mjs`
    - **Expected Outcome:** The command should exit with a status code of 0, verifying that the ESLint configuration file has been removed.
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** N/A
    - **Expected Log:** N/A
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** N/A

## Commit 3: feat: configure biome [docs/tasks/2024-08-16-15-00-install-biome.md]

**Description:**
A `biome.json` configuration file will be created in the project root by running `pnpm biome init`. The generated file will be modified to enable and configure the formatter and linter according to project standards.

Key configurations will include:

- `formatter.indentStyle`: `"tab"`
- `javascript.formatter.semicolons`: `"as-needed"` (to enforce no semicolons where possible)
- `javascript.formatter.quoteStyle`: `"double"`
- `linter.rules.recommended`: `true`

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    - **Command:** `cat biome.json`
    - **Expected Outcome:** The contents of `biome.json` should be displayed, matching the specified configuration.
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `pnpm exec biome check biome.json`
    - **Expected Log:** Biome will analyze its own configuration file and should report that it is valid with no diagnostics.
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** N/A

## Commit 4: feat: add biome scripts to package.json [docs/tasks/2024-08-16-15-00-install-biome.md]

**Description:**
To simplify usage, npm scripts for Biome will be added to `package.json`. These will replace any old scripts that used ESLint or Prettier.

- `lint`: `biome lint .`
- `format`: `biome format --write .`
- `check`: `biome check --write .`

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    - **Command:** `grep 'biome' package.json | wc -l`
    - **Expected Outcome:** The command should return at least 3, corresponding to the new scripts.
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** `pnpm check --help`
    - **Expected Log:** The help menu for the `biome check` command should be displayed, confirming the script is correctly wired.
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** N/A

## Commit 5: chore: format project with biome [docs/tasks/2024-08-16-15-00-install-biome.md]

**Description:**
The `pnpm check` script will be executed to apply the new formatting and linting rules across the entire codebase. This will reformat all relevant files, removing unnecessary semicolons and ensuring consistency. All resulting file changes will be staged for this commit.

**Verification:**

1.  **Automated Test(s):**
    - **Command:** `pnpm check`
    - **Expected Outcome:** The command will run and report any files it has fixed. A second run of the same command should produce no output and report no required changes.
2.  **Logging Check:**
    - **Action:** Review the output from the initial `pnpm check` command.
    - **Expected Log:** The output should provide a summary of all files that were checked and fixed by the formatter and linter.
    - **Toggle Mechanism:** N/A
