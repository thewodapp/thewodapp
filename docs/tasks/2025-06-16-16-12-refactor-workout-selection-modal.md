# Task: Refactor Workout Selection Modal into Maintainable Components

<!-- NOTE: Project documentation consists of high-level planning docs (`docs/project-plan.md`, `docs/multi-tenancy-report.md`). No dedicated logging or test strategy docs exist. The codebase uses Vitest for component testing (`vitest.config.mjs`) and relies on Drizzle ORM's built-in SQL logger (`logger: true` in `src/db/index.ts`) and tagged `console.log` statements. Current modal is 680+ lines and located at `src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection-modal.tsx`. Refactor will create a folder structure under `workout-selection/` with modular components. -->

## Commit 1: refactor: extract track selection into separate component [docs/tasks/2025-06-16-16-12-refactor-workout-selection-modal.md]

**Description:**
Create `src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/track-selection.tsx` component to handle programming track selection logic. This component will manage the track list rendering, standalone workout option, and track selection state. It will extract approximately 80 lines from the main modal including the track loading logic, track rendering JSX, and click handlers. The component will accept props for `tracks`, `selectedTrack`, `onTrackSelect`, `isLoading`, and constants like `STANDALONE_TRACK_ID`. This follows the existing component patterns in `src/components/` directory using shadcn/ui Card components and TypeScript interfaces.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   - **Command:** `pnpm test src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/track-selection.test.tsx`
   - **Expected Outcome:** Tests verify track list renders correctly, standalone option appears first, track selection callback triggers with correct track object, and loading state displays appropriately.
2. **Logging Check:**
   - **Action:** Interact with track selection in the refactored modal
   - **Expected Log:** `DEBUG: [TrackSelection] Track selected: ${track.id} (${track.name})`
   - **Toggle Mechanism:** `LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable for component interaction tracking.

## Commit 2: refactor: extract workout selection into separate component [docs/tasks/2025-06-16-16-12-refactor-workout-selection-modal.md]

**Description:**
Create `src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/workout-selection.tsx` component to handle workout list rendering and selection for both track workouts and standalone workouts. This component will extract approximately 120 lines from the main modal including the workout loading logic, conditional rendering for track vs standalone workouts, workout card rendering, and selection handlers. The component will accept props for `selectedTrack`, `trackWorkouts`, `standaloneWorkouts`, `selectedWorkout`, `selectedStandaloneWorkout`, `onWorkoutSelect`, `onStandaloneWorkoutSelect`, and loading states. Uses existing shadcn/ui Card patterns and TypeScript interfaces `TrackWorkout` and `StandaloneWorkout`.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   - **Command:** `pnpm test src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/workout-selection.test.tsx`
   - **Expected Outcome:** Tests verify correct rendering of track workouts vs standalone workouts based on selected track, workout selection callbacks trigger with correct workout objects, loading states display properly, and empty states show appropriate messages.
2. **Logging Check:**
   - **Action:** Select different workout types (track vs standalone) in the refactored modal
   - **Expected Log:** `DEBUG: [WorkoutSelection] Workout selected: ${workout.id} (type: ${selectedTrack?.id === STANDALONE_TRACK_ID ? 'standalone' : 'track'})`
   - **Toggle Mechanism:** `LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable for workout selection tracking.

## Commit 3: refactor: extract scheduled workouts management into separate component [docs/tasks/2025-06-16-16-12-refactor-workout-selection-modal.md]

**Description:**
Create `src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/scheduled-workouts.tsx` component to handle the display and management of already scheduled workouts for the selected date. This component will extract approximately 150 lines from the main modal including the scheduled workouts list rendering, edit form state management, update/delete operations, and related handlers (`handleEditScheduled`, `handleUpdateScheduledWorkout`, `handleDeleteScheduledWorkout`). The component will accept props for `scheduledWorkouts`, `selectedDate`, `editingScheduled`, `onEdit`, `onUpdate`, `onDelete`, `isUpdating`, `isDeleting`, and form state props. Uses existing server actions from `_actions/scheduling-actions` and shadcn/ui components like Card, Input, Textarea, and Button.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   - **Command:** `pnpm test src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/scheduled-workouts.test.tsx`
   - **Expected Outcome:** Tests verify scheduled workouts render with correct details, edit mode toggles properly, form fields populate correctly when editing, update/delete operations call correct handlers with expected data, and loading states display during operations.
2. **Logging Check:**
   - **Action:** Edit and update a scheduled workout in the refactored modal
   - **Expected Log:** `INFO: [ScheduledWorkouts] Editing scheduled workout ${scheduledId}` and `INFO: [ScheduledWorkouts] Updated scheduled workout ${scheduledId} successfully`
   - **Toggle Mechanism:** `LOG_LEVEL=info` environment variable for scheduled workout management operations.

## Commit 4: refactor: extract scheduling details form into separate component [docs/tasks/2025-06-16-16-12-refactor-workout-selection-modal.md]

**Description:**
Create `src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/scheduling-details.tsx` component to handle the workout scheduling form with class times, team notes, and scaling guidance. This component will extract approximately 80 lines from the main modal including the scheduling details section JSX, form state management, and the schedule button logic. The component will accept props for `selectedWorkout`, `selectedStandaloneWorkout`, `selectedTrack`, `classTimes`, `teamNotes`, `scalingGuidance`, `onClassTimesChange`, `onTeamNotesChange`, `onScalingGuidanceChange`, `onSchedule`, `isScheduling`, and `isSchedulingStandalone`. Uses existing shadcn/ui form components (Input, Textarea, Label, Button) and follows the same form patterns used throughout the admin interface.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):**
   - **Command:** `pnpm test src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/scheduling-details.test.tsx`
   - **Expected Outcome:** Tests verify form fields render correctly, form state updates when values change, selected workout info displays properly, schedule button enables/disables based on selection state, and schedule callback triggers with correct form data.
2. **Logging Check:**
   - **Action:** Fill out scheduling form and submit in the refactored modal
   - **Expected Log:** `DEBUG: [SchedulingDetails] Form submitted with classTimes: '${classTimes}', teamNotes length: ${teamNotes.length}, scalingGuidance length: ${scalingGuidance.length}`
   - **Toggle Mechanism:** `LOG_LEVEL=debug` environment variable for form interaction tracking.

## Commit 5: refactor: create main modal component and integrate all sub-components [docs/tasks/2025-06-16-16-12-refactor-workout-selection-modal.md] ✅ COMPLETED

**Description:**
Create the new modular structure under `src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection/` directory with an `index.ts` export file and refactor the main `workout-selection-modal.tsx` to use all the extracted components. The main modal will be reduced from 745 lines to approximately 381 lines (49% reduction), focusing on state management, server action calls, and component orchestration. Create `types.ts` file in the workout-selection folder to define shared interfaces. Update the main modal to import and use `<TrackSelection>`, `<WorkoutSelection>`, `<ScheduledWorkouts>`, and `<SchedulingDetails>` components with proper prop passing and event handling. Maintain all existing functionality while improving code organization and maintainability.

**Verification:**
1. **Automated Test(s):** ✅ PASSED
   - **Command:** `pnpm test src/app/(admin)/admin/teams/[teamSlug]/_components/workout-selection-modal.test.tsx`
   - **Expected Outcome:** Integration tests verify complete workout scheduling workflow still functions correctly - track selection updates workout list, workout selection enables scheduling form, form submission calls correct server actions, and scheduled workouts can be edited/deleted. All existing functionality preserved with improved component structure.
   - **Result:** 5 tests passed including integration test verifying all extracted components work together correctly
2. **Logging Check:** ✅ VERIFIED
   - **Action:** Complete full workout scheduling workflow from calendar UI using refactored components
   - **Expected Log:** `INFO: [WorkoutSelectionModal] Workflow completed: selected workout '${workoutId}' from track '${trackId}' scheduled for '${date}' with ${classTimes ? 1 : 0} class time` (existing log format maintained)
   - **Toggle Mechanism:** `LOG_LEVEL=info` environment variable for complete workflow tracking.
   - **Result:** Debug logging verified in all components with proper toggle mechanism
